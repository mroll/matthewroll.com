So I&rsquo;ve started daydreaming cryptocurrency applications and playing around with the technology.</p>\n\n<p>Most recently some things came together in my mind that made me interested in building a thing that lets you send crypto to people by publishing the transactions on Twitter. I&rsquo;ve been spending a bunch of time on Twitter tweeting about things I&rsquo;m thinking about and trying to make internet friends. I think the platform is really undervalued at the moment and I like thinking about what will be possible in a world where it realizes its potential. Which is to say this idea that I had is not exclusive to Twitter, it can be built on any social platform, but Twitter is the one I&rsquo;m thinking about and using right now.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway so the core of the idea is &ldquo;publishing transactions online.&rdquo; The cryptographic nature of cryptocurrency means all spending activity, all sending and receiving money, can be public for anyone to look at. For every bitcoin in existence, it&rsquo;s possible to trace it all the way from when it was created, every time it was spent, to what Bitcoin address currently owns it. There is no risk in this information being public because only the person who owns the secret key behind an address has the power to spend the Bitcoin associated with that address.</p>\n\n<p>An implication of the Bitcoin system being secure even when all transaction information is out in the open is that you can post transactions anywhere. If there is a way to get that transaction information &ndash; info that sends Bitcoin from one address to another &ndash; to a Bitcoin miner, then the transaction will go through and the person on the receiving end will get Bitcoin.</p>\n\n<p>This quote from <a href=\"https://theinternetofmoney.info\">The Internet of Money</a> is what planted the seed in my mind when I read the book a few months ago.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Bitcoin is fundamentally different. What I’m transmitting is not the key, but simply a signed message. It is an authorization. That authorization has two external references: (1) to where the money’s coming from by referencing an unspent output on the blockchain, and (2) a reference to where I want to send the money — by creating a new encumbrance, a new limitation on who can spend the money, usually a public key or bitcoin address. That transaction contains no sensitive data. If you steal the information in the transaction, all you know is which address the money came from, which address the money’s going to, and how much. That’s it. The signature reveals nothing. The addresses reveal nothing. There are no identifiers. You could take the transaction and print it out. You could post it on a billboard. You could shout it from the rooftop. A bitcoin transaction can be transmitted over completely unsecured Wi-Fi. By smoke signal. By light signal. With carrier pigeons. It doesn’t matter. Nothing in that message can be compromised.”</p>\n\n<p>Excerpt From: Andreas M.

I ultimately decided not to pursue the idea any further than the the proof of concept phase, but I ended up spending a decent chunk of time playing around with self-hosting my own bitcoin node in the cloud.

As time goes on, however, and bcoin remains unmaintained, it will not be smart to use in mission-critical projects.

You can find it by clicking on its row in the <strong>Instances</strong> page in the EC2 console, and copying the <strong>Public IPv4 address</strong> from the top middle of the <strong>Details</strong> section.</p>\n\n<p>Then, using the key as authentication, ssh into your new server at that address.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"lang-sh\">$ ssh -i ~/keys/bcoin-node-key.pem ubuntu@<ip-address></code></pre>\n\n<p>You should get a prompt that looks something like this:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2021/5c531298db.png\" width=\"580\" height=\"408\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>Yay!</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"install-bcoin\">Install bcoin</h1>\n\n<p>Run this command to install nvm, a version manager for Node.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"lang-sh\">$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.37.2/install.sh | bash</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then log out and back in so that the nvm executable gets put into the <code>PATH</code>.\nAnd run this to install the latest version of Node.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"lang-sh\">$ nvm install node</code></pre>\n\n<p>Install build tools</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"lang-sh\">$ sudo apt-get install build-essential</code></pre>\n\n<p>Download bcoin</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"lang-sh\">$ git clone git://github.com/bcoin-org/bcoin.git</code></pre>\n\n<p>Install bcoin</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"lang-sh\">$ cd bcoin\n$ npm rebuild\n$ npm install --global</code></pre>\n\n<p>This will install the <strong>bcoin</strong> executable on your system.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"run-bcoin\">Run bcoin</h1>\n\n<p>Next step is running the node, which you can do by executing the <strong>bcoin</strong> command and passing in some configuration options.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s possible to run a full node with bcoin, which means downloading every single block included in the Bitcoin blockchain and keeping it on disk. This requires a lot of disk space &ndash; over 300GB &ndash; and that would mean paying for that storage because it doesn&rsquo;t fall within the AWS free tier.</p>\n\n<p>So instead of running a full node, we will run a Simple Payment Verification (SPV) node. This means instead of our node downloading and saving every single block in the Bitcoin blockchain, it will just download the headers for the entire blockchain. This takes up much less disk space, not even a gig on my machine. This trimmed down version of a node will still enable us to send and store Bitcoin, but we are essentially trusting other full nodes that the chain information we are receiving from them is correct.</p>\n\n<p>Ok so we want to run an spv node, and we want to expose the Node API through HTTP so we can send send requests to get info, initiate transactions, and manage our wallet. We also want to run the node as a background process so that it keeps running after we log out.</p>\n\n<p>The bcoin executable provides configuration options for supporting this setup. Here is the command you want to run. Note that you will probably want to change the API key.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"lang-sh\">$ bcoin \\\n  --http-host=0.0.0.0 \\\n  --api-key=<api-key> \\\n  --wallet-http-host=0.0.0.0 \\\n  --wallet-api-key=<api-key> \\\n  --spv \\\n  --daemon</code></pre>\n\n<p>To confirm bcoin is running properly, run <code>bcoin-cli info ——api-key &lt;your-api-key&gt;</code>.

This isn&rsquo;t secure and we need to do something about it, otherwise people would be able to snoop on your communications to the node. They would be able to steal your API key and then use that to steal your Bitcoin 😮</p>\n\n<p>To secure the communications to our node, we will set up an SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) Certificate on the server, which will be used to encrypt traffic.</p>\n\n<p>SSL certs are free from a great product called LetsEncrypt, but we need a domain name first. There are lots of places to get a domain name, and most are on the order of $10-12 per year. I use Google Domains.</p>\n\n<p>If you already have a domain name, you don&rsquo;t need to buy a new one for this project. You can just use a subdomain like <code>bcoin.mywebsite.com</code>. In fact that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing and is what we will learn how to do in this guide.</p>\n\n<p>So, please go and buy a domain name if you don&rsquo;t have one yet 🙂. The following sections will assume you have one.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"create-an-a-record\">Create An A Record</h2>\n\n<p>Before we can set up our SSL cert, we need to point our domain name at the server.

These will be important in a second when we update our bcoin command with the newly created SSL info.</p>\n\n<p>In order to update our bcoin node to start encrypting traffic, we need to stop it and start it up again with configuration options containing the SSL files.</p>\n\n<p>Stop the bcoin node by running</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"lang-sh\">$ bcoin-cli rpc stop</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then start it up again with the following command. We pass in configuration options to point both the node server and the wallet server to the same SSL cert files.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"lang-sh\">$ bcoin \\\n  --http-host=0.0.0.0 \\\n  --api-key=<api-key> \\\n  --wallet-http-host=0.0.0.0 \\\n  --wallet-api-key=<api-key> \\\n  --ssl-cert=<certificate-file> \\\n  --ssl-key=<key-file> \\\n  --wallet-ssl-cert=<certificate-file> \\\n  --wallet-ssl-key=<key-file> \\\n  --spv \\\n  --daemon</code></pre>\n\n<h1 id=\"access-the-bcoin-node-remotely\">Access The bcoin Node Remotely</h1>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;ve seen that it&rsquo;s pretty easy to SSH into the server that&rsquo;s running the node and interact with it from there, but there is a much more flexible way of querying the node.</p>\n\n<p>When we passed in the <code>http-*</code> and <code>ssl-*</code> config options to the bcoin daemon, we told it to start up a web server and start listening to API requests. We will now do some setup on our local machine and see some examples of sending API requests to the cloud server from your computer at home or wherever you are.</p>\n\n<p>On your local machine (which just means your laptop or desktop when you&rsquo;re not logged into a remote server), follow the steps from the <strong>Install bcoin</strong> section above to install bcoin.

				"content_text": "This past weekend I went down something of a bitcoin programming rabbit hole while exploring an idea for [sending crypto to people over Twitter](https://matthewroll.com/2021/04/01/weekend-bitcoin-project.html). I ultimately decided not to pursue the idea any further than the the proof of concept phase, but I ended up spending a decent chunk of time playing around with self-hosting my own bitcoin node in the cloud. I wrote up my learnings into this guide, which will hopefully be useful to someone as an intro into bitcoin hacking 🙂\n\n_[Warning: The bcoin software is no longer actively maintained, but several companies (including purse.io) use it in production. As time goes on, however, and bcoin remains unmaintained, it will not be smart to use in mission-critical projects. I still think it is a valuable educational tool that can be used for smaller, non-critical projects.]_\n\n# Table of Contents\n\n1.

The server that you can run within these limits is quite capable of hosting something for a personal project, so the deal is actually really great. (**Note:** After the year is up, if you still don't want to pay for the hosting, you can sign up again with the same email using the + format. ex: matt+aws2021@gmail.com. Don't worry, you're not hurting Jeff's bottom line.)\n\nHead over to [this](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start) link to create your account. You will have to enter payment information but as long as you stay within the free tier you won't be charged. Everything we do in this guide falls under the free tier.\n\n# Launch an EC2 Instance\n\nEC2 stands for Elastic Cloud Compute, and is the AWS product for running servers in the cloud. This is where we will run our Bitcoin node.\n\n- From the AWS dashboard view (which you will see when you log in for the first time), select EC2 from the top section.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/49b0e78555.png\" width=\"750\" height=\"375\" alt=\"\" />\n\n- On the next page, click the big orange button that says **Launch Instance**.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/045a5b14c9.png\" width=\"750\" height=\"375\" alt=\"\" />\n\n- Find and select **Ubuntu Server 20.04** in **Step 1: Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)**. Click **Next**.\n- Select Type **t2.micro** from **Step 2: Choose an Instance Type**. Click **Next**.\n- Leave default settings in **Step 3: Configure Instance Details**. Click **Next**.\n- Leave default settings in **Step 4: Add Storage**. Click **Next**.\n- Leave default settings in **Step 5: Add Tags**. Click **Next**.\n- In **Step 6: Configure Security Group**:\n    - Edit the **Security group name** to be **bcoin-node-sg**.\n    - Add the following rule:\n        - **Type:** HTTP\n        - **Port range:** 80\n        - **Source:** Anywhere\n    - Add the following rule:\n        - **Type:** Custom TCP\n        - **Port range:** 8332\n        - **Source:** My IP\n        - **Description:** bcoin node main net\n    - Add the following rule:\n        - **Type:** Custom TCP\n        - **Port range:** 8334\n        - **Source:** My IP\n        - **Description:** bcoin wallet main net\n    - Click **Review and Launch**.\n- Click **Launch**.\n- When the modal asks you to download a new key, name it something descriptive like **bcoin-node-key**, and click **Download**.\n    - Navigate back to the EC2 Dashboard and click into the **Instances** page. You will see your new server! You can name it something fun by clicking the pencil that shows up in the **Name** column. Mine is called boringly just \"bcoin\".\n    \n<img src=\"uploads/2021/2c7b8d39ec.png\" width=\"750\" height=\"375\" alt=\"\" />\n\n# Login To Your Server\n\nFirst thing is to move your private key file to some location where you'll remember where it is. I have a <code>~/keys</code> directory in my home folder where I keep private keys. You can set that up like this\n\n<pre><code class=\"lang-sh\">$ mkdir ~/keys\n$ mv ~/Downloads/bcoin-node-key.pem ~/keys</code></pre>\n\nThen find the IP address of the new server. You can find it by clicking on its row in the **Instances** page in the EC2 console, and copying the **Public IPv4 address** from the top middle of the **Details** section.\n\nThen, using the key as authentication, ssh into your new server at that address.\n\n<pre><code class=\"lang-sh\">$ ssh -i ~/keys/bcoin-node-key.pem ubuntu@<ip-address></code></pre>\n\nYou should get a prompt that looks something like this:\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/5c531298db.png\" width=\"580\" height=\"408\" alt=\"\" />\n\nYay!\n\n# Install bcoin\n\nRun this command to install nvm, a version manager for Node.\n\n<pre><code class=\"lang-sh\">$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.37.2/install.sh | bash</code></pre>\n\nThen log out and back in so that the nvm executable gets put into the `PATH`.\nAnd run this to install the latest version of Node.\n\n<pre><code class=\"lang-sh\">$ nvm install node</code></pre>\n\nInstall build tools\n\n<pre><code class=\"lang-sh\">$ sudo apt-get install build-essential</code></pre>\n\nDownload bcoin\n\n<pre><code class=\"lang-sh\">$ git clone git://github.com/bcoin-org/bcoin.git</code></pre>\n\nInstall bcoin\n\n<pre><code class=\"lang-sh\">$ cd bcoin\n$ npm rebuild\n$ npm install --global</code></pre>\n\nThis will install the **bcoin** executable on your system.\n\n# Run bcoin\n\nNext step is running the node, which you can do by executing the **bcoin** command and passing in some configuration options.\n\nIt's possible to run a full node with bcoin, which means downloading every single block included in the Bitcoin blockchain and keeping it on disk.

The following sections will assume you have one.\n\n## Create An A Record\n\nBefore we can set up our SSL cert, we need to point our domain name at the server. Do this by going into the admin panel of whatever domain name registrar you bought the domain from. For Google Domains,\n\n- Go to [this](https://domains.google.com/registrar/) link\n- Click into the domain name\n- Select **DNS** from the left side panel\n- Scroll all the way down to the **Custom resource records** section\n- Type **bcoin** into the leftmost text box, and copy/paste your server's IP address into the rightmost text box.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/094df48199.png\" width=\"678\" height=\"128\" alt=\"\" />\n\n- Leave the record type as **A**.\n- Click **Add**.\n\n## Set Up LetsEncrypt\n\nWe will be using the [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) software developed by the non-profit [Internet Security Research Group (ISRG)](https://www.abetterinternet.org).\n\nRun the following\n\n<pre><code class=\"lang-sh\">$ sudo snap install core; sudo snap refresh core\n$ sudo snap install --classic certbot\n$ sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot\n$ sudo certbot certonly --standalone</code></pre>\n\nWhen prompted for the domain name, enter it as `bcoin.mywebsite.com` without any protocol information like `http://` or `https://`.\nWhen the certification process finishes you'll see an output with something like this at the bottom.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/83816bd083.png\" width=\"566\" height=\"200\" alt=\"\" />\n\nThe first file listed in that message is the **certificate file**, and the second file listed is the **key file**. These will be important in a second when we update our bcoin command with the newly created SSL info.\n\nIn order to update our bcoin node to start encrypting traffic, we need to stop it and start it up again with configuration options containing the SSL files.\n\nStop the bcoin node by running\n\n<pre><code class=\"lang-sh\">$ bcoin-cli rpc stop</code></pre>\n\nThen start it up again with the following command. We pass in configuration options to point both the node server and the wallet server to the same SSL cert files.\n\n<pre><code class=\"lang-sh\">$ bcoin \\\n  --http-host=0.0.0.0 \\\n  --api-key=<api-key> \\\n  --wallet-http-host=0.0.0.0 \\\n  --wallet-api-key=<api-key> \\\n  --ssl-cert=<certificate-file> \\\n  --ssl-key=<key-file> \\\n  --wallet-ssl-cert=<certificate-file> \\\n  --wallet-ssl-key=<key-file> \\\n  --spv \\\n  --daemon</code></pre>\n\n# Access The bcoin Node Remotely\n\nWe've seen that it's pretty easy to SSH into the server that's running the node and interact with it from there, but there is a much more flexible way of querying the node.\n\nWhen we passed in the `http-*` and `ssl-*` config options to the bcoin daemon, we told it to start up a web server and start listening to API requests. We will now do some setup on our local machine and see some examples of sending API requests to the cloud server from your computer at home or wherever you are.\n\nOn your local machine (which just means your laptop or desktop when you're not logged into a remote server), follow the steps from the **Install bcoin** section above to install bcoin. We won't be using it to run a node, but it comes bundled with command line tools for querying the node and the wallet server running with the node.\n\n## Create Config Files\n\nOnce you have bcoin on your system, create a file at `~/.bcoin/bcoin.conf` and add the following:\n\n<pre><code class=\"lang-yaml\">url: bcoin.mywebsite.com\napi-key: <your-api-key></code></pre>\n\nCreate another file at `~/.bcoin/wallet.conf` and add the following:\n\n<pre><code class=\"lang-yaml\">url: bcoin.mywebsite.com\napi-key: <your-api-key></code></pre>\n\nNow when we use the command line tools, they will automatically find the remote host and the api key, so we won't have to explicitly pass in those options for every command.\n\n## Run Some Commands\n\n### Get Node Info\n\nThe most simple command is\n\n<pre><code class=\"lang-sh\">$ bcoin-cli info</code></pre>\n\nIt shows you some metadata about your node like how much progress it's made syncing up with the full chain (1 means it is fully synced), what version it's running, how long it's been running and how much RAM it's using.\n\n### Manage Your Wallet\n\nThe bcoin software comes with a bitcoin wallet, which you can see a more in depth guide for [here](https://bcoin.io/guides/wallets.html). I basically followed that guide and will just reproduce some commands here.\n\nTo see all of the existing wallets, run\n\n<pre><code class=\"lang-sh\">$ bwallet-cli admin wallets</code></pre>\n\nTo create a new account inside an existing wallet run\n\n<pre><code class=\"lang-sh\">$ bwallet-cli account create <account-name> --id=<wallet-name></code></pre>\n\nTo get the address of an account in an existing wallet, run\n\n<pre><code class=\"lang-sh\">$ bwallet-cli address --account=<account-name> --id=<wallet-name></code></pre>\n\nThat's about the extent to which I've explored the bcoin wallet software at this point. Like I said up top, I'm not storing any BTC in this node. Just hacking around for pure fun so far.\n",

You just call it from wherever you are and it finds the nearest ancestor directory that has a `.git` file.\n\nBy combining these two it was pretty easy to write a function that runs my desired behavior.\n\n<pre><code class=“lang-elisp”>(defun mpr/helm-rg-from-dir ()\n    (interactive)\n    (let ((helm-rg--current-dir\n\t          (expand-file-name\n\t            (projectile-complete-dir (projectile-acquire-root))\n\t            (projectile-acquire-root))))\n      (helm-rg helm-pattern)))\n</code></pre>\n\nAnd then I bound it to the convenient `SPC d /` like I mentioned above.\n\n<pre><code class=“lang-lisp”>(evil-define-key 'normal (kbd \"SPC d /\") 'mpr/helm-rg-from-dir)\n</code></pre>\n",

				"title": "Emacs Status Update",
				"content_html": "<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> I decided to exit pre-built Emacs configuration packages and build my own config from scratch. See the whole thing at the bottom of this post.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Last time I wrote about Emacs it was about how to set up JavaScript editing tools in Doom Emacs. I had switched to Doom Emacs because I was having significant performance problems with Spacemacs, and Doom advertised a bunch of performance optimizations. It turns out I was just doing something stupid with Spacemacs, probably like not restarting it for months or letting some configuration bloat build up. So I ended up switching back because I prefer the Spacemacs defaults to Doom. And the performance problems went away.</p>\n\n<p>But I still was not able to get the editing tools working that I wanted to use when writing JavaScript. Specifically I want to have</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Automatic linting</li>\n<li>Automatic formatting</li>\n<li>Autocompletion with language and type support</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Which means I need to have three plugins working together. Those being</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>flycheck</li>\n<li>prettier-js</li>\n<li>lsp-mode</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This is one of those things that should be really easy to get working. Writing JavaScript is something so many people need to do that it should be possible to set up a good environment in just a few lines of code, and there should be high quality guides all over the internet explaining how to do it. Maybe Emacs is just not a popular enough editor. Anyway I was surprised at how difficult it is to get working in Spacemacs.</p>\n\n<p>I finally almost got something working by configuring my layers like this</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"lang-elisp\">\nsyntax-checking\n(auto-completion :variables\n                 auto-completion-enable-snippets-in-popup t\n                 :disabled-for org git)\nlsp\n(javascript :variables \n            node-add-modules-path t\n            javascript-backend 'lsp\n            javascript-lsp-linter nil)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And there are a couple other pieces of the configuration like</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Installing the <code>add-node-modules-path</code> package</li>\n<li>Installing the <code>typescript-language-server</code> via npm</li>\n<li>Installing <code>eslint</code> via npm</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>But even then, when I open a <code>.jsx</code> file, Emacs fails to find my <code>eslint</code> executable. And I just couldn&rsquo;t get <code>exec-path-from-shell</code> working to fix that.</p>\n\n<p>I got fed up and I figured that the source of my frustration is how many abstractions and layers of code there are between me and the actual packages when using Spacemacs.</p>\n\n<p>So I decided to build my config from scratch. Which is something that I had avoided until now. I really liked Spacemacs. It came batteries included, and I really like those batteries. I also <em>love</em> the ergonomic keybindings. Using <code>SPC</code> as the leader key and having the helpful hydra there to make everything super discoverable was a massive jump in Emacs sophistication that I didn&rsquo;t even know existed before I found Spacemacs. That was almost four years ago, and now I&rsquo;m a much more experienced Emacs user. I feel like I know what the landscape of popular packages looks like, and I&rsquo;ve put in a decent amount of time writing my own elisp. So three days ago when I felt like the batteries-included approach of Spacemacs was hindering my ability to understand and have control over my configuration, I decided it was the right time to build my own configuration.</p>\n\n<p>I had been seeing the <a href=\"https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el\">straight.el</a> package manager being used by <a href=\"https://blog.jethro.dev/\">some people</a> who I consider pretty hardcore Emacs users, so that was where I decided to start my custom configuration.</p>\n\n<p>Turns out building a configuration with straight.el is suuuuuper easy. Just pop this code at the top of your <code>init.el</code>.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"lang-elisp\">\n(defvar bootstrap-version)\n(let ((bootstrap-file\n       (expand-file-name \"straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el\" user-emacs-directory))\n      (bootstrap-version 5))\n  (unless (file-exists-p bootstrap-file)\n    (with-current-buffer\n    (url-retrieve-synchronously\n     \"[raw.githubusercontent.com/raxod502/...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raxod502/straight.el/develop/install.el)\"\n     'silent 'inhibit-cookies)\n      (goto-char (point-max))\n      (eval-print-last-sexp)))\n  (load bootstrap-file nil 'nomessage))\n\n(straight-use-package 'use-package)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now you have the full power of the beautiful <a href=\"https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package\">use-package</a> configuration interface at your fingertips. On average I&rsquo;m able to install and configure each package I enjoyed having in Spacemacs in less than five lines. Here&rsquo;s an example of how I install and configure <a href=\"https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm\">helm</a>.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"lang-elisp\">\n(use-package helm\n  :straight t\n  :config\n  (helm-mode 1)\n\n  ;; For navigating in helm popups\n  (define-key helm-map (kbd \"C-j\") 'helm-next-line)\n  (define-key helm-map (kbd \"C-k\") 'helm-previous-line))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I went through all the functionality I had come to expect from Spacemacs and just installed the packages directly.

It took me a few minutes to figure out how to configure that for myself, but I eventually found a mention of <code>bind-map</code> in Spacemacs documentation.</p>\n\n<p><code>bind-map</code> works by taking pairs of <code>(key sequence, command)</code> and binding the command to the key sequence. You can make these bindings specific to any key map — I have a few bindings that are only active when you are in a helm popup.</p>\n\n<p>Not all of my custom keybindings are registered using <code>bind-map</code>, I have a few that I register in the <code>use-package</code> blocks under the <code>:config</code> section. I have a feeling I&rsquo;ll want to consolidate all keybindings at some point, but for now this is working.</p>\n\n<p>I use the <code>bind-map</code> interface to define all key sequences that follow the <code>SPC</code> leader key. Here is my whole <code>bind-map</code> block:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"lang-elisp\">\n(use-package bind-map\n  :straight t\n  :config\n  (bind-map my-base-leader-map\n    :keys (\"M-m\")\n    :evil-keys (\"SPC\")\n    :evil-states (normal motion visual))\n\n  (bind-map-set-keys my-base-leader-map\n    ;; M-x\n    \"SPC\" 'helm-M-x\n    \n    ;; File commands\n    \"ff\" 'helm-find-files\n    \"fs\" 'save-buffer\n    \"feR\" 'reload-config\n    \"fed\" 'open-config-file\n    \"fj\"  'dired-this-buffer\n\n    ;; Window commands\n    \"wm\" 'delete-other-windows\n    \"wd\" 'delete-window\n    \"ws\" 'split-window-below\n    \"wv\" 'split-window-right\n    \"wl\" 'windmove-right\n    \"wh\" 'windmove-left\n    \"wk\" 'windmove-up\n    \"wj\" 'windmove-down\n    \"wF\" 'make-frame\n    \"wo\" 'other-frame\n\n    ;; Buffer commands\n    \"TAB\" 'switch-to-last-buffer\n    \"bb\"  'helm-buffers-list\n    \"bd\"  'kill-this-buffer\n    \"ss\"  'helm-swoop\n    \"br\"  'revert-buffer\n\n    ;; Frame commands\n    \"tF\" 'toggle-frame-fullscreen\n\n    ;; Project commands\n    \"gs\"  'magit-status\n    \"pf\"  'projectile-find-file\n    \"pp\"  'projectile-switch-project\n    \"/\"   'helm-projectile-rg\n\n    ;; Syntax commands\n    \"el\" 'flycheck-list-errors\n\n    ;; Help\n    \"hk\" 'describe-key\n    \"hf\" 'describe-function\n    \"hv\" 'describe-variable\n    \"hm\" 'describe-mode\n\n    ;; Emacs\n    \"qr\" 'restart-emacs\n    )\n\n  (bind-map-set-keys helm-find-files-map\n    \"C-h\" 'helm-find-files-up-one-level\n    \"C-l\" 'helm-execute-persistent-action\n    \"TAB\" 'helm-execute-persistent-action\n    \"C-j\" 'helm-next-line\n    \"C-k\" 'helm-previous-line)\n\n  )\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The hydra package was something I seriously considered putting in my config, but eventually decided I don’t need it. It’s one of my favorite features of Spacemacs because it makes it possible for a beginner to discover lots of functionality just by looking around. The thing is I’m not a beginner anymore and I don’t need an interface that I’ve designed and only I use to be discoverable. As of this writing I have all my keybindings memorized, and since I use them all so often, I’m not at risk of forgetting anything. For those reasons plus the effort it would take to design my own hydra menus, I’ve decided to leave that package out of my config for now.</p>\n\n<p>I guess I should mention that I figured out how to get all of my JavaScript editing tools working! Because of course it&rsquo;s not actually that complicated. But since I had such a hard time of it, I&rsquo;ll post a standalone tutorial in the next week or so.</p>\n\n<p>And that&rsquo;s the lowdown on my new Emacs config 🙂 There are a few workflow type things that I haven&rsquo;t included here like how I use org mode and how I version control my configuration (spoiler: <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html\">GNU stow</a>), but I feel like those are worth their own posts.</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the current state of my new config.</p>\n\n<pre>\n<code class=\"lang-elisp\">\n;;;

				"content_text": "**tl;dr:** I decided to exit pre-built Emacs configuration packages and build my own config from scratch. See the whole thing at the bottom of this post.\n\n---\n\nLast time I wrote about Emacs it was about how to set up JavaScript editing tools in Doom Emacs. I had switched to Doom Emacs because I was having significant performance problems with Spacemacs, and Doom advertised a bunch of performance optimizations. It turns out I was just doing something stupid with Spacemacs, probably like not restarting it for months or letting some configuration bloat build up. So I ended up switching back because I prefer the Spacemacs defaults to Doom. And the performance problems went away.\n\nBut I still was not able to get the editing tools working that I wanted to use when writing JavaScript. Specifically I want to have\n\n- Automatic linting\n- Automatic formatting\n- Autocompletion with language and type support\n\nWhich means I need to have three plugins working together. Those being\n\n1. flycheck\n2. prettier-js\n3. lsp-mode\n\nThis is one of those things that should be really easy to get working. Writing JavaScript is something so many people need to do that it should be possible to set up a good environment in just a few lines of code, and there should be high quality guides all over the internet explaining how to do it. Maybe Emacs is just not a popular enough editor. Anyway I was surprised at how difficult it is to get working in Spacemacs.\n\nI finally almost got something working by configuring my layers like this\n\n<pre><code class=\"lang-elisp\">\nsyntax-checking\n(auto-completion :variables\n                 auto-completion-enable-snippets-in-popup t\n                 :disabled-for org git)\nlsp\n(javascript :variables \n            node-add-modules-path t\n            javascript-backend 'lsp\n            javascript-lsp-linter nil)\n</code></pre>\n\nAnd there are a couple other pieces of the configuration like\n\n1. Installing the `add-node-modules-path` package\n2. Installing the `typescript-language-server` via npm\n3. Installing `eslint` via npm\n\nBut even then, when I open a `.jsx` file, Emacs fails to find my `eslint` executable. And I just couldn't get `exec-path-from-shell` working to fix that.\n\nI got fed up and I figured that the source of my frustration is how many abstractions and layers of code there are between me and the actual packages when using Spacemacs.\n\nSo I decided to build my config from scratch. Which is something that I had avoided until now. I really liked Spacemacs. It came batteries included, and I really like those batteries. I also *love* the ergonomic keybindings. Using `SPC` as the leader key and having the helpful hydra there to make everything super discoverable was a massive jump in Emacs sophistication that I didn't even know existed before I found Spacemacs. That was almost four years ago, and now I'm a much more experienced Emacs user. I feel like I know what the landscape of popular packages looks like, and I've put in a decent amount of time writing my own elisp. So three days ago when I felt like the batteries-included approach of Spacemacs was hindering my ability to understand and have control over my configuration, I decided it was the right time to build my own configuration.\n\nI had been seeing the [straight.el](https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el) package manager being used by [some people](https://blog.jethro.dev/) who I consider pretty hardcore Emacs users, so that was where I decided to start my custom configuration.\n\nTurns out building a configuration with straight.el is suuuuuper easy. Just pop this code at the top of your `init.el`.\n\n<pre><code class=\"lang-elisp\">\n(defvar bootstrap-version)\n(let ((bootstrap-file\n       (expand-file-name \"straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el\" user-emacs-directory))\n      (bootstrap-version 5))\n  (unless (file-exists-p bootstrap-file)\n    (with-current-buffer\n\t(url-retrieve-synchronously\n\t \"[raw.githubusercontent.com/raxod502/...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raxod502/straight.el/develop/install.el)\"\n\t 'silent 'inhibit-cookies)\n      (goto-char (point-max))\n      (eval-print-last-sexp)))\n  (load bootstrap-file nil 'nomessage))\n\n(straight-use-package 'use-package)\n</code></pre>\n\nNow you have the full power of the beautiful [use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package) configuration interface at your fingertips. On average I'm able to install and configure each package I enjoyed having in Spacemacs in less than five lines. Here's an example of how I install and configure [helm](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm).\n\n<pre><code class=\"lang-elisp\">\n(use-package helm\n  :straight t\n  :config\n  (helm-mode 1)\n\n  ;; For navigating in helm popups\n  (define-key helm-map (kbd \"C-j\") 'helm-next-line)\n  (define-key helm-map (kbd \"C-k\") 'helm-previous-line))\n</code></pre>\n\nI went through all the functionality I had come to expect from Spacemacs and just installed the packages directly.

It took me a few minutes to figure out how to configure that for myself, but I eventually found a mention of `bind-map` in Spacemacs documentation.\n\n`bind-map` works by taking pairs of `(key sequence, command)` and binding the command to the key sequence. You can make these bindings specific to any key map — I have a few bindings that are only active when you are in a helm popup.\n\nNot all of my custom keybindings are registered using `bind-map`, I have a few that I register in the `use-package` blocks under the `:config` section. I have a feeling I'll want to consolidate all keybindings at some point, but for now this is working.\n\nI use the `bind-map` interface to define all key sequences that follow the `SPC` leader key. Here is my whole `bind-map` block:\n\n<pre><code class=\"lang-elisp\">\n(use-package bind-map\n  :straight t\n  :config\n  (bind-map my-base-leader-map\n    :keys (\"M-m\")\n    :evil-keys (\"SPC\")\n    :evil-states (normal motion visual))\n\n  (bind-map-set-keys my-base-leader-map\n    ;; M-x\n    \"SPC\" 'helm-M-x\n    \n    ;; File commands\n    \"ff\" 'helm-find-files\n    \"fs\" 'save-buffer\n    \"feR\" 'reload-config\n    \"fed\" 'open-config-file\n    \"fj\"  'dired-this-buffer\n\n    ;; Window commands\n    \"wm\" 'delete-other-windows\n    \"wd\" 'delete-window\n    \"ws\" 'split-window-below\n    \"wv\" 'split-window-right\n    \"wl\" 'windmove-right\n    \"wh\" 'windmove-left\n    \"wk\" 'windmove-up\n    \"wj\" 'windmove-down\n    \"wF\" 'make-frame\n    \"wo\" 'other-frame\n\n    ;; Buffer commands\n    \"TAB\" 'switch-to-last-buffer\n    \"bb\"  'helm-buffers-list\n    \"bd\"  'kill-this-buffer\n    \"ss\"  'helm-swoop\n    \"br\"  'revert-buffer\n\n    ;; Frame commands\n    \"tF\" 'toggle-frame-fullscreen\n\n    ;; Project commands\n    \"gs\"  'magit-status\n    \"pf\"  'projectile-find-file\n    \"pp\"  'projectile-switch-project\n    \"/\"   'helm-projectile-rg\n\n    ;; Syntax commands\n    \"el\" 'flycheck-list-errors\n\n    ;; Help\n    \"hk\" 'describe-key\n    \"hf\" 'describe-function\n    \"hv\" 'describe-variable\n    \"hm\" 'describe-mode\n\n    ;; Emacs\n    \"qr\" 'restart-emacs\n    )\n\n  (bind-map-set-keys helm-find-files-map\n    \"C-h\" 'helm-find-files-up-one-level\n    \"C-l\" 'helm-execute-persistent-action\n    \"TAB\" 'helm-execute-persistent-action\n    \"C-j\" 'helm-next-line\n    \"C-k\" 'helm-previous-line)\n\n  )\n</code></pre>\n\nThe hydra package was something I seriously considered putting in my config, but eventually decided I don’t need it. It’s one of my favorite features of Spacemacs because it makes it possible for a beginner to discover lots of functionality just by looking around. The thing is I’m not a beginner anymore and I don’t need an interface that I’ve designed and only I use to be discoverable. As of this writing I have all my keybindings memorized, and since I use them all so often, I’m not at risk of forgetting anything. For those reasons plus the effort it would take to design my own hydra menus, I’ve decided to leave that package out of my config for now.\n\nI guess I should mention that I figured out how to get all of my JavaScript editing tools working! Because of course it's not actually that complicated. But since I had such a hard time of it, I'll post a standalone tutorial in the next week or so.\n\nAnd that's the lowdown on my new Emacs config 🙂 There are a few workflow type things that I haven't included here like how I use org mode and how I version control my configuration (spoiler: [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html)), but I feel like those are worth their own posts.\n\nHere's the current state of my new config.\n\n<pre>\n<code class=\"lang-elisp\">\n;;;

				"content_html": "\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://matthewroll.com/2020/12/31/a-healthy-news.html\">previous post</a> I described what I thought a healthy news diet might look like. I wanted to lay out a framework that would allow me to stay informed in ways I care about, but would also keep me from using news as a way to pass time and indulge in an addiction to the feed. I came up with the following criteria for a healthy news diet:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Specific things you want to get out of reading news</li>\n<li>A plan for how to get those things out of reading news</li>\n<li>A list of non-news activities you want to use to pass time</li>\n<li>Slots during your week that you will use to read news</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In this post I&rsquo;m going to fill in each of those items for myself. Once I&rsquo;ve filled out that plan, I&rsquo;ll start to follow it. And I will keep track of how closely I follow it. In my paper journal I&rsquo;ve added two sections to track</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>how many times I use the predetermined slots to read the news</li>\n<li>how many times outside of the predetermined slots I read news</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The combination of those statistics should be a good measurement of how closely I&rsquo;m sticking to my new &ldquo;healthy news diet.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s just the quantitative side. After a month I&rsquo;ll do a write up of how I feel it&rsquo;s going.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"specific-things-you-want-to-get-out-of-reading-news\">Specific things you want to get out of reading news</h1>\n\n<p>I have a hunch keeping this list short is important. Maybe a rule of thumb would be to keep it under five. I care to keep up-to-date on</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The health of the US economy</li>\n<li>Virus outbreaks</li>\n<li>New tech around cloud-based app development</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As far as this section is concerned, I think that&rsquo;s really all you need. A list of bullets. They can be super high level, because you will have time to think more carefully and drill down on each of them in the next section.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"a-plan-for-how-to-get-those-things-out-of-reading-news\">A plan for how to get those things out of reading news</h1>\n\n<p>This section is for coming up with what information you are going to look for and what sources you are going to look at for each of the items in the previous section.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-health-of-the-us-economy\">The health of the US economy</h2>\n\n<p>There are lots of statistics that people use to measure the health of the economy. I looked at a bunch of them and decided I care about knowing the current state and trends over time of the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Weekly unemployment claims</li>\n<li>Percent change in the price of the SP 500 over the past week, month, and quarter.</li>\n<li>Consumer spending</li>\n<li>Corporate debt levels</li>\n<li>Government debt levels</li>\n<li>Rate of inflation</li>\n<li>Treasury Yield Curve</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now, the US economy is a massive beast ($20tn!) and the statistics listed above are not likely to change much week to week. So I&rsquo;m thinking of only checking these once every month or even every quarter.</p>\n\n<p>I found a site called <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/\">Trading Economics</a> which seems to provide reputable time series charts for every stat in my list, except the Treasury Yield Curve, which I can get from <a href=\"https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=yield\">treasury.gov</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"virus-outbreaks\">Virus outbreaks</h2>\n\n<p>Before 2020, I would not have placed news about viruses high on my list of things to keep track of. In fact it would not have made my list. But obviously things are different now.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, I&rsquo;ve been able to stay a step ahead of mainstream news and online publications (CNN, WSJ, NYT, Vox, Slate, etc.) by following smart people and scientists on Twitter. February 27th was the first day I started taking coronavirus seriously (I really should have seen it sooner, but I was on vacation in India), and it was because of what I saw these people saying on Twitter. At the time, worrying about the virus was seen mostly as overreacting and handwringing. Hip publications were writing articles mocking the tech industry for swearing off handshakes. If you wanted to find content that was being the correct level of worried about what was coming down the pike, you had three options, as far as I can tell:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A few prominent SV venture capitalists (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1233826194350649345\">Paul Graham</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1233177158182416384\">Balaji Srinivasan</a>)</li>\n<li>Bay Area Rationalists (<a href=\"https://putanumonit.com/2020/02/27/seeing-the-smoke/\">Jacob Falkovich</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WilliamAEden/status/1232840971231981568\">William Eden</a>)</li>\n<li>Epidemiologists (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/NAChristakis/status/1233147509557493760\">Nicholas Christakis</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/firefoxx66/status/1233666678841597952\">Emma Hodcroft</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>While I appreciate the level of independent thinking that was required for the first two groups in that list to be able to spot the threat and talk about it so quickly, they all mostly tweet about things other than viruses. I&rsquo;d like to keep that independent thinking around, which is why I follow these people in my general feed. But to watch viruses specifically, I think the best thing to do is make a <a href=\"https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-lists\">Twitter List</a> full of epidemiologists, which I have done and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/lists/1342720302959104000\">made public</a>.</p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ll go every week to get a feel for what&rsquo;s going on in the world of viruses. For the time being it will serve mostly as a way to stay current on all things COVID, but after we pass through this crisis, I expect it will be among the best places on the internet to keep a finger on the pulse of potential epidemics around the world.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-tech-around-cloud-based-app-development\">New tech around cloud-based app development</h2>\n\n<p>I fancy myself a product developer. My day job is fullstack engineer for a company that sells a software service for pulling insights out of text. My current ambition is to build my own software-as-a-service company that will one day provide my full income. And I have this belief that every day, new tools and products and technologies are being built that make it easier and easier to build and run an online software business. I want to stay informed about what&rsquo;s happening in this space.</p>\n\n<p>An example, to hopefully illustrate what I mean, is Stripe&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/customer-portal\">Customer Portal</a>. I learned about this new product from a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/patrickc/status/1277703540928942080\">tweet</a> from Patrick Collison. That afternoon I used that newly released Stripe feature to build subscription billing into my library, <a href=\"https://staqjs.com/\">Staq.js</a>. Actionable news.</p>\n\n<p>To keep an eye out for more opportunities like that, I&rsquo;ve created a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/lists/1345258903584395264\">Web Dev</a> list on Twitter. Curation for this one is not as easy as the list for epidemiologists, but I&rsquo;m confident I can gradually refine it to be a great place for keeping current on what technologies people are using to build great products for the web.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"a-list-of-non-news-activities-you-want-to-use-to-pass-time\">A list of non-news activities you want to use to pass time</h1>\n\n<p>This section is for coming up with and writing down a list of things you will do <strong>instead of reading news</strong> when the temptation inevitably arises throughout the course of your day.

All uses of the second person &ldquo;you&rdquo; and &ldquo;your&rdquo; in this post are in fact me talking to myself.]</em></p>\n\n<p>If you aren’t careful, you’ll spend too much of your life scrolling a feed. Might be Twitter, HN, Reddit, NYT, etc. Could be some app that doesn’t exist yet. Doesn’t matter. The result is the same. You don’t get as much done as you want, and your soul slowly drains out into that screen.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is, scrolling through that feed can be useful. It’s not useful very often, but it&rsquo;s useful enough that you don&rsquo;t feel you should completely quit. Mostly you&rsquo;re just wasting time, but you need to know what&rsquo;s going on in the world somehow. It&rsquo;s just that the signal to noise ratio by default is so so so so bad.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s a way to increase the signal and decrease the noise. Maybe there&rsquo;s a way to make news reading an intentional part of your life that takes exactly the amount of time you allow it. Maybe. That&rsquo;s what I want to work towards in this post, anyhow. Which leads us to my working hypothesis:</p>\n\n<p><strong>There exists a balanced news diet that results in learning useful things while allowing for enough time to be productive, and also keeping your soul.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Finding that diet will require work, and sticking to it will require work. No free lunch, and all that.</p>\n\n<p>I feel like a first principles approach is called for.</p>\n\n<p>Why read news? For me it’s a way to find out what’s happening in areas of the world that I care about. It’s a way of learning about opportunities for investment, whether that be in the form of money, like buying bitcoin, or in the form of time, like deciding to read up on or tinker with a technology that seems like it will be important. Reading news is also a way to see warning signs that tell me I should be preparing for something or changing my behavior, exactly what happened this year with coronavirus.</p>\n\n<p>So what would happen if I didn’t read news? I would miss out on investments and possible career opportunities. And I might be caught wrong-footed in black swan events like a health crisis, a violent conflict, or an economic crisis.</p>\n\n<p>I think there are plenty of people who for whatever reason think that being on the lookout for such disasters is overkill. I’m not one of those people. I want to be prepared.</p>\n\n<p>Which I think logically dictates that I read some news, in some form that reliably sends me enough signal to benefit from what I described above.</p>\n\n<p>I think if you view news as a way to get information, rather than a way to pass time, then you might get most of the way to being able to implement and stick to a healthy news diet. If you just have a set of other activities that you view as ways of passing time, then when you’re bored, instead of pulling out your phone and scrolling, you’ll resort to one of those other activities.</p>\n\n<p>In that framework, reading news would be an activity that was slotted to a particular time and frequency, much like dinner or going to the gym. “I read news twice a week, on Wednesdays and Saturdays, for about an hour after dinner,” would be a typical thing to hear if people thought of news consumption as an activity whose purpose was the intake of useful information, rather than a way to pass time and release dopamine.</p>\n\n<p>So I guess that’s what a healthy news diet consists of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Specific things you want to get out of reading news</li>\n<li>A plan for how to get those things out of reading news</li>\n<li>A list of non-news activities you want to use to pass time</li>\n<li>Slots during your week that you will use to read news</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"examples-of-specific-things-you-might-want-to-get-out-of-reading-news\">Examples of specific things you might want to get out of reading news</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The health of the economy</li>\n<li>Things that might be changing or about to change the health of the economy</li>\n<li>Virus outbreaks</li>\n<li>New technological developments</li>\n<li>New scientific developments</li>\n<li>Changes in government around the world</li>\n<li>Changes in key legislative positions in the US</li>\n<li>The price of some commodity or stock or asset or security, etc.</li>\n<li>Countries with the highest rate of growth</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"examples-of-non-news-things-that-you-can-do-to-pass-time\">Examples of non-news things that you can do to pass time</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Read a book</li>\n<li>Write a blog post/essay</li>\n<li>Read high quality long form content</li>\n<li>Play chess</li>\n<li>Play go</li>\n<li>Write a journal entry</li>\n<li>Watch an episode of some show (although try to keep it to one episode)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I think one of the reasons pulling out your phone and scrolling has become the default behavior when a moment of downtime rolls around is that it&rsquo;s the most convenient action you know how to take.

I have a list called <a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/lists/1342720302959104000\">Epidemiology</a>. I think this strategy — building lists of experts on Twitter — is actually the best way of keeping up to date on fields with even a moderate level of technical complexity.

He says that since pricing environmental costs is often difficult, companies and governments mostly just consider nature&rsquo;s benefits to be free. As a solution, he thinks governments should adopt policies that allow investment into things like healthy soils and watersheds.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&hellip;This might sound far-fetched — especially coming from a former US Treasure secretary — but valuing nature as we do traditional goods and services will create incentives to avoid biodiversity destruction, manage climate change and preserve lives and livelihoods. Harnessing the power of markets can protect our environments and prevent its rapid destruction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is a radically new idea, that costs to nature must be priced into corporate activities to protect the long term health of the planet. I like the spin of thinking about natural resources and ecosystems as an asset class that can be invested in via electronic markets. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind owning shares in my favorite ecosystems. 🌲</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3 id=\"effect-of-tax-on-stock-price\">Effect of Tax on Stock Price</h3>\n\n<p>The stock prices of companies trading at high multiples of earnings are most vulnerable to policies that increase corporate tax.</p>\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s say you have two companies, A and B. They are both earning at $10/share, but company A is trading at 25 times earnings and company B is trading at 10 times earnings. A new tax comes along and cuts earnings for both companies by 10 percent. Let&rsquo;s look at what happens to the stock price as calculated by an earnings multiple.</p>\n\n<p>Company A original stock price = $10 * 25 = $250</p>\n\n<p>Company B original stock price = $10 * 10 = $100</p>\n\n<p>Company A new stock price = ($10 * 0.9) * 25 = $225</p>\n\n<p>Company B new earnings = ($10 * 0.9) * 10 = $90</p>\n\n<p>The company trading at a higher earnings multiple gets hit with a $25 drop in stock price, while the company trading at the lower multiple only sheds $10 per share. For shareholders who value their equity at (number of shares) * (share price), the $25 drop is a bigger hit to their investment.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>UBS reckons Mr Biden&rsquo;s tax proposals could shave about 8 per cent off S&amp;P 500 company earnings. Businesses on steep multiples would be most exposed. These include Faang stocks such as Facebook and Amazon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3 id=\"currency-strength-implications\">Currency Strength Implications</h3>\n\n<p>A strong currency is bad for trade income. If your goods are more expensive for other countries, they will purchase fewer of them.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The euro is up 10 per cent against the US dollar since March, a shift that could weigh on inflation by lowering the price of imports and drag on the eurozone&rsquo;s economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic by raising the cost of its exports to other parts of the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

As a solution, he thinks governments should adopt policies that allow investment into things like healthy soils and watersheds.\n\n> ...This might sound far-fetched — especially coming from a former US Treasure secretary — but valuing nature as we do traditional goods and services will create incentives to avoid biodiversity destruction, manage climate change and preserve lives and livelihoods. Harnessing the power of markets can protect our environments and prevent its rapid destruction.\n\nI don't think this is a radically new idea, that costs to nature must be priced into corporate activities to protect the long term health of the planet. I like the spin of thinking about natural resources and ecosystems as an asset class that can be invested in via electronic markets. I wouldn't mind owning shares in my favorite ecosystems. 🌲\n\n---\n\n### Effect of Tax on Stock Price\n\nThe stock prices of companies trading at high multiples of earnings are most vulnerable to policies that increase corporate tax.\n\nLet's say you have two companies, A and B. They are both earning at $10/share, but company A is trading at 25 times earnings and company B is trading at 10 times earnings. A new tax comes along and cuts earnings for both companies by 10 percent. Let's look at what happens to the stock price as calculated by an earnings multiple.\n\nCompany A original stock price = $10 * 25 = $250\n\nCompany B original stock price = $10 * 10 = $100\n\nCompany A new stock price = ($10 * 0.9) * 25 = $225\n\nCompany B new earnings = ($10 * 0.9) * 10 = $90\n\nThe company trading at a higher earnings multiple gets hit with a $25 drop in stock price, while the company trading at the lower multiple only sheds $10 per share. For shareholders who value their equity at (number of shares) * (share price), the $25 drop is a bigger hit to their investment.\n\n> UBS reckons Mr Biden's tax proposals could shave about 8 per cent off S&P 500 company earnings. Businesses on steep multiples would be most exposed. These include Faang stocks such as Facebook and Amazon.\n\n---\n\n### Currency Strength Implications\n\nA strong currency is bad for trade income. If your goods are more expensive for other countries, they will purchase fewer of them.\n\n> The euro is up 10 per cent against the US dollar since March, a shift that could weigh on inflation by lowering the price of imports and drag on the eurozone's economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic by raising the cost of its exports to other parts of the world.\n",

The choice\nof editor has almost nothing to do with optimization of editing technique. Most\neditors are extensible and can be programmed to support many editing styles. So\nin theory the ideas in this essay can be applied to any editor.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"actions-on-a-single-file\">Actions on a Single File</h2>\n\n<p>Actions taken on a single file in the process of writing code involve things\nlike writing characters to the file, moving characters to different parts of the\nfile, and navigating around the file. While I think there are ways of optimizing\neach of these areas, in this essay I will only explore the idea of writing\ncharacters to a file.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>The thing programmers do that allows them control over computers is type\ncharacters into files. This is mostly what people mean when they say someone can\n&ldquo;write code.&rdquo; They are saying that person knows what characters to type into a\nfile that, when fed to the computer, will result in the computer doing some\nexpected and, in some cases, useful thing.</p>\n\n<p>Programmers, however, do not think about writing code in terms of the characters\nthey will have to type into the computer. Programmers think about writing code\nin terms of metaphors like &ldquo;function,&rdquo; &ldquo;http request,&rdquo; &ldquo;database connection,&rdquo;\nand &ldquo;hash table.&rdquo; There is a translation process that happens in the\nprogrammer&rsquo;s head when they sit down to the keyboard that turns those terms into\nthe right characters.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of doing that translation process in my head, I want the computer to do\nit for me. I don&rsquo;t want to use my typing to tell the computer, one at a time,\nthe individual characters to put on screen. I want to use my typing to tell the\ncomputer which metaphor I want to insert into this file. The computer should\nhave the characters for that metaphor on disk.</p>\n\n<p>It takes on average many fewer characters to select from a set of metaphors than\nit does to type out that metaphor. The computer can infer from the file\nextension what language is being used, so we don&rsquo;t need to select from the list\nof metaphors in every language, just the language we&rsquo;re working with. That\nmassively reduces the set of metaphors and makes the number of bits necessary to\nselect an individual one manageable.</p>\n\n<p>What does this selection process look like? There should be some key chord that\nbrings up the menu of available metaphors, and typing part of the metaphor\nshould filter the menu by fuzzy search. Commonly used metaphors can be bound to\ntheir own key chords.</p>\n\n<p>In this way you can select any code pattern in less than ten keystrokes.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"actions-on-the-filesystem\">Actions on the Filesystem</h2>\n\n<p>In my experience, the common actions taken on the filesystem in the process of\nbuilding software are creating files, deleting files, moving files, searching\nfor files, and searching for things in files. The editor should provide the\nability to do all these things with as few keystrokes as possible, since they\nhappen frequently.  And since the need for any one of these actions is most\nlikely to come up in the process of writing code in the editor, the editor\nshould support these operations so you don&rsquo;t have to context switch to another\napplication.</p>\n\n<p>To support the write actions &ndash; create, move, delete &ndash; the ideal interface\nmight be an in-editor file browser operated by the keyboard. Bring up the file\nbrowser with a short two- or three-character key chord. Navigate within a\ndirectory with <code>j</code> and <code>k</code>. Navigate between directories with <code>J</code> and <code>K</code>.\nDelete files with <code>d</code> or <code>x</code>, followed by a confirmation prompt to prevent data\nloss from accidental key presses. Mark files for moving with <code>m</code> or <code>r</code> (for\n&ldquo;rename&rdquo;) and then navigate to the new location in the browser and hit <code>m</code> or\n<code>r</code> again to carry out the move. Create a new file in the current directory with\n<code>o</code> (for &ldquo;open&rdquo;).</p>\n\n<p>Searching for files should work something like this: a short key chord brings up\nthe search window. Typing into the search bar filters a list of files in the\nproject by fuzzy match on their file path. Flags can be passed to the search\nstring which further filter on things like file type and directory; these flags\ncan be made to be inclusive or exclusive. Once the desired file is in view,\nnavigate to it via <code>Ctrl-j</code> and <code>Ctrl-k</code> and hit enter to open it.</p>\n\n<p>Searching for strings in files should work much the same way. Instead of fuzzy\nmatching on the file path, the search string should fuzzy match on lines in the\nfile, using a tool like ag or ripgrep.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"actions-on-the-editor\">Actions on the Editor</h2>\n\n<p>The editor application should itself be malleable. It should be able to split\ninto an arbitrarily nested grid of panes, each showing the contents of a\ndifferent file or process.

				"title": "After Emacs",
				"content_html": "<p>Emacs is clearly the best text and code editing tool on the market, but it&rsquo;s not perfect. It&rsquo;s slower than I&rsquo;d like - the UI doesn&rsquo;t update immediately with every keystroke and I often find myself waiting for the helm buffer to update before I hit the next keystroke.</p>\n\n<p>Configuring emacs is non-trivial. Too low-level. You have to know too much about package variable names and functions.</p>\n\n<p>Emacs doesn&rsquo;t look as good as more recent editors like GitHub&rsquo;s Atom.</p>\n\n<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t come with good enough productivity packages. You have to go out and discover those by combing through blog posts and random peoples&rsquo; GitHub repos.</p>\n\n<p>Emacs might be the state of the art, but it&rsquo;s not the ideal.</p>\n\n<p>So, what is after Emacs?</p>\n\n<p>In a sentence: a version of Emacs that is blazing fast, looks great, is configurable via an intuitive graphical interface, and comes setup with amazing productivity apps.</p>\n\n<p>One way of creating this tool is to start with a bare-bones Emacs and add on packages and write better interfaces. But I&rsquo;m not sure you can get past the performance limitations of Emacs Lisp. My understanding is that Sublime Text 2 is the popular IDE with the best performance. Which makes sense, it being written almost entirely in C++.</p>\n\n<p>Atom is an Electron app, which means Javascript. But I don&rsquo;t have enough experience using it, and have not heard enough on the subject, to be able to say how fast it is. (Ok a quick google search reveals a complaint about Atom performance: <a href=\"https://dev.to/ben/why-i-switched-from-atom-to-visual-studio-code\">dev.to/ben/why-i&hellip;</a>)</p>\n\n<p>What about VSCode? Could that be the foundation for a post-Emacs editor? How configurable is it and how fast is it? Apparently about the same as Atom, both being significantly worse than Sublime. <a href=\"https://blog.xinhong.me/post/sublime-text-vs-vscode-vs-atom-performance-dec-2016/\">blog.xinhong.me/post/subl&hellip;</a></p>\n\n<p>Ok, fine. How about starting with Sublime and building org-mode, projectile, helm, magit, etc. on top of it? The reason I hadn&rsquo;t considered it before the other two editors is my impression is Sublime is not as configurable. But let&rsquo;s see.

				"content_text": "Emacs is clearly the best text and code editing tool on the market, but it's not perfect. It's slower than I'd like - the UI doesn't update immediately with every keystroke and I often find myself waiting for the helm buffer to update before I hit the next keystroke.\n\nConfiguring emacs is non-trivial. Too low-level. You have to know too much about package variable names and functions.\n\nEmacs doesn't look as good as more recent editors like GitHub's Atom.\n\nAnd it doesn't come with good enough productivity packages. You have to go out and discover those by combing through blog posts and random peoples' GitHub repos.\n\nEmacs might be the state of the art, but it's not the ideal.\n\nSo, what is after Emacs?\n\nIn a sentence: a version of Emacs that is blazing fast, looks great, is configurable via an intuitive graphical interface, and comes setup with amazing productivity apps.\n\nOne way of creating this tool is to start with a bare-bones Emacs and add on packages and write better interfaces. But I'm not sure you can get past the performance limitations of Emacs Lisp. My understanding is that Sublime Text 2 is the popular IDE with the best performance. Which makes sense, it being written almost entirely in C++.\n\nAtom is an Electron app, which means Javascript. But I don't have enough experience using it, and have not heard enough on the subject, to be able to say how fast it is. (Ok a quick google search reveals a complaint about Atom performance: [dev.to/ben/why-i...](https://dev.to/ben/why-i-switched-from-atom-to-visual-studio-code))\n\nWhat about VSCode? Could that be the foundation for a post-Emacs editor? How configurable is it and how fast is it? Apparently about the same as Atom, both being significantly worse than Sublime. [blog.xinhong.me/post/subl...](https://blog.xinhong.me/post/sublime-text-vs-vscode-vs-atom-performance-dec-2016/)\n\nOk, fine. How about starting with Sublime and building org-mode, projectile, helm, magit, etc. on top of it? The reason I hadn't considered it before the other two editors is my impression is Sublime is not as configurable. But let's see. To Google!\n\n[Later that day]\n\nI installed Sublime Text and tried to write AngularJS code for a couple hours this afternoon. It didn't go that well.

Good luck.”</p>\n<p>When viewed as a warning that our major systems are broken in how they interact with one another, <em>The Wire</em> has a sad and disappointing legacy. The show could have been the spark that brought multipolar trap problems into the mainstream conversation. Instead it’s remembered by a small percentage of people as a great piece of media. An admirable accomplishment for sure but so far short of its potential in my eyes.</p>\n<p>I want to end this on a happy note. And so I’ll say “At least they tried.” I’m so glad <em>The Wire</em> exists. For many it is an amazing piece of entertainment. For me it is that, but more importantly it is a study of the core failure mode of the institutions that we’ve entrusted with the power to protect and strengthen us as a people.

And unfortunately it’s not on television anymore.</p>\n<p>For sure there is a lot of good content coming out right now. <em>Killing Eve</em> is good, <em>Better Call Saul</em> is good, and I’m watching this show on Amazon Prime called <em>The Boys</em> which is surprisingly good. But nothing I’m seeing is such a blatant, accurate, entertaining commentary on <em>extremely important issues</em>.</p>\n<p>And I think if someone did make a show like that right now, it would get a lot of good attention.</p>\n<p>Anyway.</p>\n<p><em>The Wire</em> is the television version of <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/\">Meditations on Moloch</a>. It’s a vivid explanation of how systems with perverse incentives basically end up screwing everyone over. Which is actually super refreshing because it’s not trying to simplify anything. It’s like trying to tell us “These are hard problems! You can’t just tell the police to make more arrests! You can’t just have politicians with good intentions! In order to sort out this mess you are going to have to foster cooperation between several major entities with <em>misaligned incentives</em>. Good luck.”</p>\n<p>When viewed as a warning that our major systems are broken in how they interact with one another, <em>The Wire</em> has a sad and disappointing legacy. The show could have been the spark that brought multipolar trap problems into the mainstream conversation. Instead it’s remembered by a small percentage of people as a great piece of media. An admirable accomplishment for sure but so far short of its potential in my eyes.</p>\n<p>I want to end this on a happy note. And so I’ll say “At least they tried.” I’m so glad <em>The Wire</em> exists. For many it is an amazing piece of entertainment. For me it is that, but more importantly it is a study of the core failure mode of the institutions that we’ve entrusted with the power to protect and strengthen us as a people. I think it’s important we praise and keep trying to create art like that.</p>\n",

Bindwandle knew he had to stay hidden. His absence would be discovered soon and messages would be sent. There would be eyes on the road, waiting for him.</p>\n\n<p>So he sighed as he entered the forest, far from where the road cut an easy path through the trees.

He spotted a small fire and three men sitting around it. They were all visibly armed. Bindwandle assumed these were the ones waiting for him, and that more than likely there was at least one more on patrol. The road was empty and everything was quiet except the crackling of the fire and low voices of the men around it.</p>\n\n<p>Bindwandle needed to know how many adversaries he was dealing with here, otherwise he couldn’t make a move and be sure he was going unnoticed. The whole point was to escape into the mountains undetected and not incur further pursuit.</p>\n\n<p>Closing his eyes, Bindwandle reached into a leather pouch strapped to his waist and pulled out a small red stone. It was sharply cut with eight faces and felt warm in Bindwandle’s hand. Much warmer than the air around it. Summoning up the words to a spell – one memorized long ago in an old underground library – he invoked the spell, yanking power out of the stone for his own use.</p>\n\n<p>When he opened his eyes, it was like the heavy darkness had won. There was nothing but straight black, not even the faint silhouette of trees against the light of the torches by the pass entry. But Bindwandle shifted his gaze towards where he knew the fire was, and saw three glowing silhouettes green against the black of everything else. Noting those, he began a full circle rotation.

Keeping far enough away from the fire as to be invisible against the jet black backdrop of the rock face, he crossed the gap. He didn’t go to the pass entry. Instead he went to a pile of rocks a ways away. It was a big pile, and there were openings where large slabs lay against each other at angles.
